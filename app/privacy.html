        <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>Our privacy policy explains how information is collected, used, and disclosed by Rai and Rohl Technologies, Inc. (&#34;we&#34;, &#34;us&#34;, &#34;Jio Health&#34;) with respect to your access and use of Jio Health's services, whether through our website (located at <a href="www.jiohealth.com">www.Jiohealth.com</a>) or Jio Health's mobile applications (collectively,  &#34;the Jio Health Service,&#34; &#34;the Service&#34;). When we use the term &#34;Personal Information&#34; in this document, we mean any information that can be used to contact or identify you (such as your name or email address, or your medication list in combination with other information that identifies you).</p>

        <h3>IS REGISTRATION NECESSARY?</h3>
        <p>Registration is required to use the Jio Health Service and enable you to access your account information on multiple devices. Registering also enables you to recover your information in the event you change mobile phones or reinstall the application on your mobile device. We may also require registration to allow you to redeem certain offers or gifts. Finally, if you download the Jio Health Service in connection with a program offered by an employer, healthcare provider, pharmacy benefit manager, or other healthcare professional in collaboration with us (collectively, &#34;Benefit or Healthcare Provider&#34;), you may be required to register with such Benefit or Healthcare Provider in connection with such program and provide certain Personal Information to such provider. We are not responsible for the use of any Personal Information that you may decide to provide to any Benefit or Healthcare Provider in connection with the use of the Jio Health Service or the program overall.</p>

        <h3>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h3>
        <p>If you decide to complete our registration process, send us an email or post information or other content to the Jio Health Service, we collect Personal Information from you, such as your name, email address and phone number, as well as certain non-identifying information, like information related to your vitals (weight, blood pressure, blood glucose, steps/activity), medications or supplements you are taking and your individual preferences.</p>
        <p>We also collect and store any content that you upload, download or access via the Jio Health Service, which may include Personal Information about you (including pictures of your prescription or over the counter medication that you decide to upload).</p>
        <p>If you download the Jio Health Service in connection with a program offered by a Benefit or Healthcare Provider and enter an activation code provided to you by your Benefit or Healthcare Provider, your Benefit or Healthcare Provider may provide us Personal Information about you, such as your medication list and refill reminders for us to pass on to you.</p>
        <p>We may automatically collect certain information when you use the Jio Health Service, such as Internet Protocol (IP) address (if using a browser), operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring site and your activity on Jio Health. This information is not treated as Personal Information unless we combine it with or link it to any of the personally identifiable information mentioned above. As with many other sites, we may also use "cookies&#34; or web beacons. These are small files that your browser places on your computer. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our services, and to improve our services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. In addition, some third parties that we work with (e.g. Kiss Metrics and other technologies used to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing programs) may use their proprietary technologies to analyze your use of the Jio Health Service. Please note that this Privacy Policy covers only the use of cookies and other similar technologies by us, and does not cover the use of third-party technologies.</p>

          </p>
          <p>We may receive remuneration from third parties for communicating with your about their products or services, or for providing you with promotional items from them.</p>

              <li>we may share your information, including Personal Information, with service providers who have a contractual relationship with us in connection with the operation of our Services (these service providers have access to your Personal Information only to perform services on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose it or use it for any other purposes);</li>
              <li>if you access the Jio Health Service in connection with a program offered by a Benefit or Healthcare Provider, enter an activation code provided to you by the Benefit or Healthcare Provider or otherwise authenticate to a Benefit or Healthcare Provider in the Jio Health Service, we may provide Personal Information about you to the Benefit or Healthcare Provider, including data related to your use of, and interaction with, Jio Health. The Benefit or Healthcare Provider may be able to associate the Personal Information we provide with you;</li>
              <li>we may aggregate Personal Information from multiple users in a manner that removes the ability to associate Personal Information with an individual user (&#34;Aggregated Information&#34;), and share the Aggregated Information with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes;</li>
              <li>when you give us your consent to do so, including if we notify you that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information;</li>

            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>We may receive remuneration from third parties for sharing your Personal Information with them in the circumstances described above. We are not responsible for the actions of service providers or other third parties, nor are we responsible for any additional information you provide directly to any third parties.</p>

          <h3>RESTRICTIONS AND REQUESTS</h3>
          <p>You have the right to request that we restrict use or disclosure of Personal Information for treatment, payment or health care operations, disclosure to persons involved in your health care or payment for health care, or disclosure to notify family members or others about your general condition, location, or death. However, please be advised that we are under no obligation to agree to such requests for restrictions. Please also note that any restriction that we agree to, we will comply with.</p>
          <p>You have the right to request to a copy of your Personal Information. Requests may be made in writing to: 3 PARKER, IRVINE, CA 92618. Please note that we may deny you access in certain situations, such as when Jio Health and/or a Healthcare Provider believes that access could cause harm to you or another. In such a situation, you will be given the right to have such a denial reviewed by a licensed Healthcare Provider for a second opinion. Jio Health reserves the right to impose reasonable, cost-based fees for the processing of a request.</p>

          <h3>LINKS TO OTHER SITES OR APPLICATIONS</h3>
          <p>The Jio Health Service may contain links to other sites or applications. Any information you provide on those sites or applications is provided directly to the owner of that site or application and is subject to that party's privacy policy.

          <h3>WHAT STEPS DO WE TAKE TO PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION ONLINE?</h3>
          <p>We are very concerned with safeguarding your information and employ reasonable measures to do that. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
          <p>We adhere to industry-leading standards and best practices to manage our network, servers, web and client applications, and set security policies across our organization.</p>
